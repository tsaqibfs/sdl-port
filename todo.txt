TODO, which will get actually done
==================================

- SDL: CompatibilityHacksForceScreenUpdate=y does not redraw screen after putting to background and restoring.

- SDL: add option for non-fullscreen non-immersive mode.

- SDL: SdlVideoResizeKeepAspect=y mouse location shifted near right border.

- SDL: Text input window still blocks touches sometimes after text input is finished.

- SDL: Right mouse button sometimes gets stuck in tap or hold mode, faster scrollwheel while not moving mouse cursor.

- SDL: SD card permission dialog does nothing on Android 10.

- SDL2: Back button does not work.
